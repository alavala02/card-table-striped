                <p>Radka Denemarková is something of a phenomenon in contemporary Czech literature. She is the only writer to have won the highest Czech literary award, the Magnesia Litera Prize, four times in total, in different categories (fiction, non-fiction, translation and Book of the Year) and is now gaining a wider readership through translations and international awards. Perhaps her most notorious novel is Peníze od Hitlera (meaning “money from Hitler”) which describes the story of a Jewish Holocaust survivor who returns to Czechoslovakia after WWII and is denied recognition of her most basic rights.

                    Denemarková grew up in communist Czechoslovakia and witnessed the fall of communism and the Berlin Wall in her youth. Those events have shaped her writing as well as her public engagement and her commitment to speak up for democracy in her region, but also in China. As the Czech Republic marks the 30th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, Global Voices asked her about her experience as an observer of changes in Central Europe, and about her concerns and hopes for the political future in this part of the world. The interview was edited for brevity.
                    
                    Filip Noubel: The Berlin Wall fell 30 years ago, and things changed drastically in Prague and Berlin. You were then living in communist Czechoslovakia, and had just started your studies at Charles University. How did you perceive the demonstrations and the fall of the regime at the time? What were your greatest concerns and hopes?
